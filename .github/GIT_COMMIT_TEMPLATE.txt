# --------------------
# Remember to
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Wrap the body at 72 characters
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
